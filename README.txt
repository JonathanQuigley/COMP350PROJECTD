This Project was done by Jonathan Quigley and Josh Sproul All steps to this project have been completed, there is a writeSector,
deleteFile, and writeFile in kernel.c and there is a copy, dir, and create in shell.c. To verify that all these commands work you can
boot up the simulator, load in the diskc.img and use the commands for example del to delete a file(ex: del messag), copy to copy 
a file (ex copy messag mess1), dir, and create.
